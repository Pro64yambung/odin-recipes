    <p>
      Easy <em>paneer</em> recipe. Add to your favorite curry or dish. Great for

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 gallon milk</li>

      <li>1 quart buttermilk</li>

      <li>1 cup canola oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour the gallon of milk into a large pot. Bring to a boil over<br />
        medium heat. Watch carefully, as it will boil over almost as soon as it
        starts to boil.<br />As the milk begins to boil, pour the buttermilk
        into the pot in a steady stream while stirring constantly.<br />The milk
        will separate into curd and water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a cheesecloth into a colander, and pour the milk mixture through
        it.<br />Reserve some of the liquid for later.<br />Let the milk mixture
        sit in the colander for a couple of hours, or until it stops dripping.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the curds are strained and settled, transfer them to a food
        processor.<br />Process until smooth. It should be able to form a ball
        if it is the right consistency.<br />If it is too dry, add a little of
        the reserved liquid and process again.<br />The consistency should be
        like a firm ricotta cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the cheese out onto a clean surface, and knead until smooth.<br />Form
        into a ball, and wrap in plastic.<br />Refrigerate until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cook the paneer, heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over
        medium-high heat.<br />Cut the paneer into bite size pieces.<br />Fry
        for about 1 minute, or until a very pale golden brown.<br />Drain on
        paper towels. Add to your favorite curry or dish.
      </li>
    </ol>
